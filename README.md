# Osteoporosis-Disease-Prediction

## Overview
This project is a **Streamlit-based** web application that predicts the risk of **osteoporosis** based on patient input data. The model used is an **XGBoost classifier**, trained on relevant features such as **age, gender, family history, body weight, calcium intake, and medical conditions**.

## Features
- üè• **User-friendly interface** for data input using **Streamlit**
- ü©∫ **Predicts the likelihood of osteoporosis** using a **pre-trained XGBoost model**
- ‚úÖ Supports various patient attributes such as **age, gender, smoking habits, prior fractures, and more**
- üìä **Displays prediction results** with probability scores

## Installation
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Virtual Environment
Run the following command to create and activate a virtual environment:

#### **Windows:**
```sh
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
Once inside the virtual environment, install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install streamlit pandas joblib scikit-learn xgboost
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Application
Start the **Streamlit** application using:
```sh
streamlit run streamlit_osteoporosis.py
```

## Input Features üìå
The following features are required for making a prediction:
- **Age** (Numeric)
- **Gender** (Male/Female)
- **Hormonal Changes** (Normal/Postmenopausal)
- **Family History** (Yes/No)
- **Race/Ethnicity** (Asian, Caucasian, African American, Other)
- **Body Weight** (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese)
- **Calcium Intake** (Low, Adequate, High)
- **Vitamin D Intake** (Insufficient/Sufficient)
- **Physical Activity** (Sedentary/Active)
- **Smoking** (Yes/No)
- **Alcohol Consumption** (None, Moderate, High)
- **Medical Conditions** (None, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Hyperthyroidism)
- **Medications** (None, Corticosteroids)
- **Prior Fractures** (Yes/No)

## Model Details üß†
The model was trained using **XGBoost**, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm. The dataset was preprocessed to handle categorical values and missing data before training.

## License üìú
